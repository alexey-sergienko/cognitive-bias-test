This is a browser-based implementation of the Cognitive Bias Test software.  
An adapted and modified version of the test by Goldberg E. et al.

The computer method Cognitive Bias Test is sensitive in terms of differential diagnosis in identifying problems in the properties of attention in various categories of subjects (children, adults, patients with mental disorders of various origins).  
With the help of this technique, cognitive-style features are revealed. E. Goldberg distinguishes context-dependent and context-independent decision-making styles. The role of context-dependent behavior is assigned to the prefrontal cortex.  
A geometric figure (target) is presented to the test subject on the monitor screen, and then two other geometric figures (choices) appear, the task is to look at the target and choose the figure of the two that the respondent likes best.  
In reality, the figures are chosen in such a way that the subjects have two options: to be based either on the properties of the target figure (which change from one test to another), or on some stable preference that is not related to the goal (for example, a favorite color or shape).  
1. Context-dependent decision-making strategy: the subjects make their choice in accordance with the goal, and if the goal changes, then their choices also change.  
2. Context-independent decision-making strategy: subjects make their choice based on stable preferences, regardless of the goal. They always choose blue or red or round or square.  
E. Goldberg's studies show that under conditions of uncertainty, subjects with damage to the frontal regions experience the greatest difficulties, they also experience a tendency to a context-independent behavior strategy.  
The CBT scale is a gradient from 0 to 70, where 0 is context independent and 70 is context sensitive.
